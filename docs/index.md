# Daily Application

This project is a space to capture and explore random ideas and projects on a daily basis. It's about the joy of "vibing coding" with AI, allowing for spontaneous creation and building things for the sake of building.

## Core Ideas

- **Record Random Ideas:** A place to jot down fleeting thoughts, shower ideas, and anything in between.
- **Daily Projects:** Small, manageable projects to work on each day.
- **AI-Powered Coding:** Using AI as a creative partner to code, explore, and learn.
- **Build for Fun:** The primary goal is to build something, anything, for the personal satisfaction of creating.
